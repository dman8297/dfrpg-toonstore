Usually, this simply means you are guided to the right place at the right time. If the GM agrees that such a circumstance is in effect, you need not spend a fate point to stage a fortuitous arrival.

If you either achieve your purpose, take any compels that would threaten to derail you from your pursuits, or refuse any compels that are meant to keep you true to your purpose, the effect immediately ends.\\n\\n* **Desperate Hour** - In times of most desperate need, you may call out a prayer for aid from the Divine. Any time you are hit by an attack that *requires* you to take a severe or extreme consequence to avoid being taken out, you may make such a prayer.

When swung without such purpose in mind and heart, the blow does not land (any attack roll automatically fails), the bond is immediately broken, and the sword falls from the wielder\'s hand.\\n\\n* **Holy** - This weapon is a powerful holy symbol in its own right. Its very touch is like holy water or that of a cross or other symbol of faith back by the belief of the possessor.\\n\\n* **It\'s a Sword** - A Sword of the Cross always takes the form of a sword, though the precise type of sword may change through the ages. There are only three in existence. As a sword, it possesses the damage and other attributes of any sword (Weapon:2).\\n\\n* **True Aim** - When swung in keeping with its purpose, a Sword of the Cross grants a +1 to the wielder\'s Weapons skill.\\n\\n* **Unbreakable** - As an Item of Power, it cannot be broken, save through dedicated magical ritual predicated upon perverting its purpose.\\n\\n* **Discount Already Applied** - As an Item of Power, the sword already includes the one-time discount \\\\[+2\\\\].

In some cases, the urge may take the form of a compel against your high concept.\"},{\"cost\":0,\"name\":\"Human Guise\",\"description\":\"Despite a variety of supernatural powers, you are able to look just like everyone else.

Using those powers will make the urge to feed rise.\\n\\n* **Hunger Is Stressful** - You have an additional stress track called **hunger**. The length of the track works like those of other stress tracks, only using Discipline as the base skill. Unlike those other stress tracks, you may not clear this out at the end of a scene.\\n\\n* **Limited Reserves** - At the end of a scene whenever you have heavily exerted your affected powers, you must check to see if you experience **feeding failure**. This manifests as an attack with a strength equal to the total refresh cost of the abilities you used; you roll Discipline to defend.\\n\\n    * If you succeed, you may clear out your hunger stress track.\\n    * If you fail, you take hunger stress as though you\'d suffered an attack. If you have physical or mental consequence slots open, you may use them to buy off the stress as per the normal rules. If you cannot or do not wish to spare consequences, then you must lose access to a number of your powers, up to a refresh cost equal to the amount of stress taken. These options can be combined however you choose.\\n    * If you have no powers left to lose and are taken out by a feeding failure, you are *actually* taken out, resulting in complete incapacitation, extreme emaciation, and other nasty fates.\\n\\n    Highly stressful or emotional situations can still trigger your need to feed, even if you\'ve already lost some or all of your abilities. In such situations, the strength of the attack is equal to half of the refresh value of your affected abilities, rounded up.\\n\\n* **Failure Recovery** - You can recover your lost abilities at the rate of up to one point per scene so long as you opt out of the scene, essentially because you are spending it feeding. You can regain *all* of your lost abilities in one scene if you feed so forcefully as to kill a victim outright. In either case, your hunger stress clears out completely, and any consequences that resulted from feeding failure vanish regardless of the usual recovery time.\"},{\"cost\":0,\"name\":\"The Catch\",\"description\":\"As a creature that feeds on negative emotion, exposure to the corresponding positive emotion bypasses your Inhuman Recovery power, and can even cause physical injury. For example, a succubus (a lust vampire) can be burned by the touch of some wedding rings (symbols of True Love).

You can recover totally from any consequence (excluding extreme ones) with no other excuse besides time; simply waiting long enough will eventually heal you completely.\\n\\n* **Fast Recovery** - Out of combat, you may recover from physical consequences as if they were one level lower in severity. Consequences reduced below mild are always removed by the beginning of a subsequent scene.\\n\\n* **Vigorous** - Endurance never restricts other skills due to a lack of rest.

When sprinting, this bonus is increased to +2.\\n\\n* **Casual Movement** - Whenever moving as part of another physical activity, you may move one zone without taking the -1 penalty for a supplemental action.\\n\\n* **Almost Too Fast To See** - Difficulty factors due to moving are reduced by two when rolling Stealth.\"},{\"cost\":-2,\"name\":\"Inhuman Strength\",\"description\":\"You are able to lift more and hit harder than the average human can, but only when tapping into your vampiric nature.\\n\\n* **Improved Lifting** - Whenever lifting or breaking inanimate objects, you gain a +3 to Might.\\n\\n* **Bruising Strength** - Roll Might at +1 whenever using that skill in conjunction with grappling. This also allows you to inflict a 2-stress hit on an opponent as a supplemental action during a grapple.\\n\\n* **Superior Strength** - Whenever using your Might to modify another skill, it always provides a +1 regardless of the actual comparison of your Might score to the skill in question.\\n\\n* **Hammer Blows** - With attacks that depend on muscular force, you are at a +2 to damage, increasing the stress dealt by two on a successful hit.\"}],\"notes\":{\"text\":\"Of all the known vampire courts, the White Court of vampires appear to be the weakest - but they are no less deadly.
